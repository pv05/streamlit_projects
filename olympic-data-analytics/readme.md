# `Olympic EDA & Dashboard Design`

### Problem Statement :
The Olympic Games are the most popular sporting event in the world, held every four years. Over the years, the event has evolved and grown in size and popularity, and as such, there is a vast amount of data available. This data can be used to gain insights into the games, including which countries have the most successful athletes, how participation has changed over time, and which sports are the most popular and many more . In this project, we aim to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of summer Olympic data from 1896 to 2016 to gain insights into the event's history and trends.
### Description :
The Olympic Games EDA Analysis project is an exploratory data analysis project aimed at analyzing summer Olympic data from 1896 to 2016. The project's primary goal is to gain insights into the games' history and trends using data visualization techniques. The project uses Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
### Data gathering : 
The dataset used in this project was gathered from Kaggle and contains information on Olympic athletes, including their name, sex, age, height, weight, team, NOC (National Olympic Committee), games, year, season, city, sport, event, medal, region, and notes.
### Data cleaning and feature engineering
 Before performing any analysis, the data was cleaned and feature engineered to ensure that the dataset was suitable for analysis.
The project's workflow begins with data cleaning, where we remove any duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns from the dataset. Once the data cleaning process is completed, we move on to feature engineering, where we create new features like athlete's age group, BMI, and country-wise medal counts.
### Advanced EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) : 
After performing the initial data cleaning and feature engineering, we perform advanced EDA using data visualization techniques. We create several visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to gain insights into the data. The visualizations show trends like which countries have won the most medals, how participation has changed over time ,which sports are the most popular and many more.
### Dashboard design using streamlit : 
Once the EDA is complete, we save the model in the pickle format, which can be used later for prediction and analysis purposes. We then create a Streamlit website that allows users to view the EDA dashboard for the Olympic Games. The website provides users with a detailed analysis of the Olympic Games' history and trends, including which country has won the most medals, which sport is the most popular, and participation trends over time.
### Dashboard deployment : 
Finally, we host the Streamlit website for free for everyone to access and use. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to view the Olympic Games' EDA dashboard, which can be accessed for everyone free.
### Conclusion :
In conclusion , the Olympic Games EDA Analysis project aims to provide a detailed analysis of summer Olympic data from 1896 to 2016. The project uses Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform advanced EDA. The project's workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, advanced EDA, saving the model in the pickle format, creating a Streamlit website, and hosting the website for free for everyone to access and use.
